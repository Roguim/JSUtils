# HeaderLinks
## Description
Add in-document links using this JS addon. It will automatically create links to all your h1-h6 elements, respecting ids as it goes.
## Usage
Add the js file to your folder and add `<script src="HeaderLinks.js" defer></script>`.``
It will automatically add links to each of your h1-h6 elements into your first <header> element.
## Documentation
If you want to make an element not appear in there, you can just add the class "invisible" to it.
If you wish to style any of the types of links, they each have their original tag as a class.
  This means that if you had a h1 tag, it becomes a link with the H1 class.
  If it was a h3, the class is H3.
